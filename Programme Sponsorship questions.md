In general : Sponsorship / Ownership / Investor / User etc

In Organisation: query whether Sponsorship focussed around Business need / IT interests

Sponsor as SPM / Sponsor as Investor / Sponsor as Functional Manager

The pairing in MSP of the Programme Manager against the Business Change Manager

Decision rights should align to responsibilities. Otherwise its just the problem to say no. 

There may be too little Sponsorship here. 

But I have been to places where there is too much. So don’t encourage them to build a huge role. 

Typically this is all a partial solution to the Principal-Agent problem…..

Eg:Government dept has  SRO’s. Under that, something like NRT would have a client and a Sponsor. Sponsor acts as Client’s agent. Manuals for each role. 

In one Infra Company there was / is an ongoing tension between the Sponsors, the Engineering Department and the Project Department

Sign off at end or set up or both ?

Most focus on Benefits or on Outcomes or on Outputs or on Project artefacts ?

Separation of powers…

What is in the PM’s interest to get right ?
Lots of standards
